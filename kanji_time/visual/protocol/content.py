"""
Define a common interface for sized and renderable report content.

The underlying concept is that all drawable elements must support a common method interface as follows:

    - measure() to provide the minimum size for the element (and any children, if present).
    - layout() to position itself (and any children) inside some area and set up a local coordinate system for drawing.
    - draw() to execute technology-specific instructions to render the drawable element

A particular implementation of a RenderingFrame knows how to draw one specific type of content: a drawing, text, etc.

The overall vision is that a particular rendering technology provides adapters for known standard RenderingFrame implementations
that either replace the implementation outright or tweak the well-known output format of a frame to suit its needs.

    - We're not quite there on this vision yet -- Kanji Time is highly dependant on ReportLab for PDF output right now.
      I'm striving to keep technology and semantics decoupled - but this is an ideal.

    Encapsulate the processing state of a content frame.

    The normal progression is
        new -> waiting -> needs_layout -> ready -> drawn

    A content frame always starts life in the 'new' state.

        - Calling "begin_page" usually sends it to the 'waiting' state from 'new' or 'drawn'.
          but could send it all the way to 'ready' if there's no measurement or layout to do.
        - Calling "measure" sends it to the 'needs_layout' or 'ready' state.
        - Calling "do_layout" sends it to the 'ready' state from 'needs_layout'
        - Calling "draw" always sends it to the 'drawn' state from 'ready'
          (unless there's an error of some kind and we can recover.)

    The drawn state my be decorated with

        - have_more_data - to indicate another page of content is available
        - reusable - to indicate that the same content can be drawn again
        - all_data_consumed - to indicate that there's nothing left to draw

    These decorator flags govern which frames appear on the next page of output.

    .. only:: dev_notes

        - think about "def ready_for(States.some_state) -> bool" to check if we are able to transit to some_state
        - think about "with next_state(States.some_state):" that

            - verifies that I can enter some_state,
            - verifies that the operations in the context, and,
            - keeps thread safety.

        - Consider something like a StateService mix-in that exposes a "next_state" context & is initialized with an enum and verifier
          functions that inspect 'self' data to determine "in_state" and "ready_for_transition"; maybe also "state_from_self".
          Really, "state_from_self" would end up as the core function that drives "in_state" and the "start_transition" exit function
          that determines success.

    Key Design Considerations
    -------------------------

    1. All layout-aware renderable objects — including both leaf and container nodes — implement this protocol.

    The intended design goal is to encapsulate all spatial negotiation, measurement, and rendering behaviors in a single object.
    This interface hides internal content representation from the layout engine.

    2. A layout algorithm receives ContentFrame instances opaque units. It only sees:

        - How large a frame wants to be (`requested_size`)
        - How large it actually is after layout (`layout_size`)
        - Whether it has more content for pagination (`States.have_more_data`)

    Every ContentFrame is (and must be) self-contained and self-managing. It may be composite or atomic, stretchable or fixed-size.
    It may render into any subregion it declares via `do_layout`.

    3. This interface serves as the polymorphic contract for all drawable elements in a layout tree.
