"""
Define a common interface for layout policy objects.

LayoutStrategy is a protocol for layout algorithms that arrange multiple elements inside a parent extent.

The layout engine provides the available space and a list of measured element sizes; the strategy returns
a layout plan that fits them into space and defines their positions.

This design allows layout policies (like stacking, wrapping, or grid layout) to be modular, testable, and composable.

    Model a policy for placing rectangular extents into a parent extent that frames them.

    The LayoutStrategy defines the interface for computing spatial layouts in a container.

    All LayoutStrategy instances must implement:
    - `measure()`: Given a list of element extents, compute the minimum bounding box to contain them.
    - `layout()`: Given a target size and list of element sizes, return the actual layout regions to place each element.

    The layout strategy is not responsible for rendering or measuring content â€” only for allocating space.
