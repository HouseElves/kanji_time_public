"""
Coordinate the interaction between a page-pump loop and a report.

The :class:`PageController` protocol provides a centralized coordination scheme to allow individual rendering frame components to manage their
output data "on-demand" such that they only need to have it when their are emitting to a page that needs it. It further ensures that all
of the RenderingFrame components of a Page are positioned and ready when it it's time to draw them.

(Note, the Kanji Summary and Practice Sheet sample reports load all their data in a monolith to keep things simple - but they could do
page-by-page management during begin_page().)

Since report controller classes will typically only want to manage data, they should delegate all the page layout interactions required of a
top-level RenderFrame to their current Page instance.  The DelegatingRenderingFrame convenience class is tailor made for this purpose.

Finally, since most of the page management work of a PageController is common across all reports, the PaginatedReport convenience class can
be used as a base class to a report controller to handle these chores in a consistent fashion.

The end result of the PageController and the two convenience classes is an uncluttered interface. We've freed up ReportController classes to
focus on their job:  creating rendering frames and directing data to them on each page as needed.
