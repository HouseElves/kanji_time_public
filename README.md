# Installing Kanji Time

You can install & run the current Kanji Time package  
**or**  
build & run Kanji Time from the source code.

## Install & Run the Current Package

Kanji Time runs on Python 3.11.0 or later.

The installation instructions below have been verified on **Windows 10** (Build 19045.5965), **Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS**, and **macOS 15.5 "Sequoia"**.  

These steps will install Kanji Time using the latest development wheel from GitHub.  

Kanji Time will be *isolated inside its own virtual environment using `venv`* so it does not interfere with your existing Python applications.

* If you're unfamiliar with virtual environments and would like to learn more, the Real Python site has an excellent [primer](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/).
* If you already use virtual environments, feel free to substitute appropriate commands for your preferred tool (such as `pyenv` or `virtualenv`).  
  Kanji Time is agnostic to how the environment is managed.

> [!NOTE]
> Ubuntu/Debian users will need to install `venv` support if it is not already present: `sudo apt install python3-venv`  
> See [Real Python's virtual environment primer](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) for platform-specific setup details.

From the command line, create (or navigate to) a parent directory for Kanji Time (e.g., `PythonApps`), then run:

### On **Windows**

```bash
python3 -m venv .kanji_time
.kanji_time\Scripts\activate
pip3 install https://github.com/HouseElves/kanji_time_public/releases/download/v0.1.2-alpha-20251123/kanji_time-0.1.2a20251123-py3-none-any.whl
```

### On **macOS** or **Linux**

```bash
python3 -m venv .kanji_time
source .kanji_time/bin/activate
pip3 install https://github.com/HouseElves/kanji_time_public/releases/download/v0.1.2-alpha-20251123/kanji_time-0.1.2a20251123-py3-none-any.whl
```

> [!TIP]
> **Having trouble?** See the [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/source/troubleshooting.md) for common installation and runtime issues.

Kanji Time will be installed into a directory named `.kanji_time` under the parent directory that you selected.

## Run Sample Reports

Generate sample kanji reports from the command line:

```bash
python3 -m kanji_time 現 生 鳥 --report=kanji_summary --report=practice_sheet
```

* This will process the characters `現`, `生`, and `鳥`, and produce PDF outputs and execution logs.

After a moment or two, you will see output like this:

```text
Loading extra kanji information...
Loading the kanji dictionary...
Beginning kanji_summary.
Processing 現...on page...1...done! PDF result in 96_現_summary.pdf
Processing 生...on page...1...2...3...done! PDF result in 100_生_summary.pdf
Processing 鳥...on page...1...done! PDF result in 196_鳥_summary.pdf
kanji_summary complete.
Finished.  Execution log in kanji_summary.log
Beginning practice_sheet.
Processing 現...on page...1...done! PDF result in 現_practice.pdf
Processing 生...on page...1...done! PDF result in 生_practice.pdf
Processing 鳥...on page...1...done! PDF result in 鳥_practice.pdf
practice_sheet complete.
Finished.  Execution log in practice_sheet.log
```

* **Output files**: Each processed kanji will have its own summary and practice sheet PDF in the current directory.

## Solving Today's Problem...

Kanji Time isn't vaporware — the fundamental architecture is *already in place* for creating clean pipelines from raw data to PDF output.

The proof is in front of you.

As of right now, Kanji Time is a valuable tool that assists me — a student of Japanese kanji — with printable PDF practice sheets and kanji dictionary summaries cross-referenced by the kanji's traditional radical.
These reports are generated on-demand from the Kanji Time command line for any kanji character that I want to study.

*This tool powers my own Japanese studies, helping me track progress, drill difficult characters, practice penmanship, and keep all my learning artifacts organized.*

---

## ... While Planning for Tomorrow's Problems ...

The design of Kanji Time was set from day 1 with **useful extensibility** as one of its major objectives.

It was not enough for me to create one-off exercise sheets: I could do that well enough with a Jupyter notebook.

I wanted a simple, *easily reusable* and intuitive codebase—an easy-to-understand, general-purpose layout tool that **completely decouples** the act of data acquisition from the act of data presentation.

Simplicity, ease of use, and, most of all, utility, are the driving forces behind the Kanji Time design philosophy.

The net result is a robust, reusable platform for framing text and vector graphics on a page, automatically laying out framed page elements, and paginating the output—all while keeping code that generates a report completely isolated from the code in these supporting presentation artifacts.

This isolation enables Kanji Time to use Python's dynamic module loading capabilities so that adding a new report is as simple as dropping in and whitelisting the Python package that generates it.

---

## ... And Setting A Good Example

The second design objective for Kanji Time was set to be a case study for my [Code in Place](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/) students learning Python.

* I wanted an easy-to-understand console application that was more than a toy that I could present to other Section Leaders and my Section students.
* The program had to be large enough to be interesting yet small enough to fit inside your head comfortably.
* The program had to avoid complex libraries or little understood Python constructs.
* Above all else, the program had to *solve a useful and relatable problem*.

The result is *Kanji Time*, a surprisingly powerful, useful, and compact application built out of simple components and algorithms in a couple of thousand lines of code.

Kanji Time doesn't just demonstrate good programming practices and the art of making design trade-offs.
It also fosters respect for good programming habits such as first-class documentation, comprehensive test suites, and rock-solid code hygiene.

Beyond these, the best lesson inside Kanji Time is that **it is not perfect.**

Kanji Time demonstrates that code does not need to be perfect to ship—but one does need to be smart about what imperfections to ship and have a plan to correct them.
