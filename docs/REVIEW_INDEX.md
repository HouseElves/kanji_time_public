## Quick Summary

### Overall Grade
- **As Teaching Tool:** B+ (with curation)
- **As Production Software:** A- (after cleanup)

### Top Strengths ‚úÖ
1. **Protocol-based architecture** - `visual/protocol/content.py` is exemplary
2. **Immutable geometry primitives** - `visual/layout/distance.py` is production-quality
3. **Clean plugin system** - Actually extensible via dynamic loading
4. **Good test coverage** for core modules
5. **Ships working software** - PDFs are generated successfully

### Top Issues ‚ùå
1. **kanji_svg.py** (965 lines) - Metaclass overengineering, side effects, GPT comments
2. **utilities/** - Dumping ground, needs organization
3. **Error handling** - Inconsistent (assertions vs exceptions)
4. **IPython dependency** - Should be dev-only
5. **Documentation tone** - Vacillates between professional and casual

## How to Use This Review

### For Instructors
1. **Read:** CODEBASE_REVIEW.md executive summary
2. **Plan:** Use TEACHING_GUIDE.md session plans
3. **Prepare:** Review the "Showcase Code" before class
4. **Assign:** Pick exercises from TEACHING_GUIDE.md

### For Students
1. **Start with:** TEACHING_GUIDE.md quick navigation
2. **Study:** The showcase code examples
3. **Practice:** Work through exercises for your level
4. **Discuss:** The "Discussion Topics" in study groups

### For the Developer
1. **Prioritize:** Fix "HIGH" items in CODEBASE_REVIEW.md first
2. **Refactor:** Use the specific examples as guides
3. **Document:** Create companion docs for intentional debt
4. **Test:** Add coverage for kanji_svg.py (critical gap)

## Key Recommendations by Priority

### üî¥ HIGH (Fix Before Showing Students)
1. Remove IPython from production dependencies
2. Fix error handling inconsistency (assertions vs exceptions)
3. Add tests for kanji_svg.py
4. Fix magic exit codes ‚Üí named constants
5. Remove "deleted by GPT" markers
6. Fix duplicate logging import

**Time estimate:** 2-4 hours

### üü° MEDIUM (Improve Teaching Value)
1. Refactor kanji_svg.py into 3 modules
2. Organize utilities module
3. Standardize documentation tone
4. Add type hints to all public APIs
5. Create "Teaching Guide" companion docs
6. Consolidate settings modules

**Time estimate:** 8-12 hours

### üü¢ LOW (Nice to Have)
1. Replace custom flatten() with stdlib
2. Add coverage measurement (pytest-cov)
3. Add CLI integration tests
4. Fix svg_transform.py tone
5. Extract validation decorators

**Time estimate:** 4-6 hours
