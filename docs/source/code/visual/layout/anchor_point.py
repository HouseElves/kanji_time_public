"""
Compass-style alignment flags used to anchor content frames within their parent containers.

The AnchorPoint enum uses bit flags to express positions like `N`, `SW`, or `CENTER` to the layout logic.

The intended consumer of an AnchorPoint instance is Extent.anchor_at(); which uses it as a hint for placing a smaller extent
inside a larger one.
