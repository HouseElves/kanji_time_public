"""
Define an immutable distance type for regions for layout.

Distance is the foundational unit of measurement in the layout system. It models real-world dimensions
(e.g., inches, points, millimeters) and supports precise arithmetic using rational math internally.

It also supports soft layout constraints via symbolic forms:

- '*' for fit-to-space behavior (e.g., '5in*' is "at least 5 inches")
- '!' for infinite/overflow behavior
- '%' and user units for device-relative or font-relative rendering

Conversions to specific units are seamless via attribute access such as `distance.inch` or `distance.pt`, among others.

All Distance math preserves rational precision unless explicitly cast to float. In layout engines like
StackLayout or Page, Distance provides the canonical language for measuring, positioning, and allocating
rendered content.

Class Relationships
-------------------

As a foundational utility type, the Distance class has a very small dependency surface.

            - this gets to an "apply constraints" semantic that adjusts a distance or a "satisfies constraints" that checks.
