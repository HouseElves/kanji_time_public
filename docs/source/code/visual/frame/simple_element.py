class SimpleElement(RenderingFrame):
    """
    A frontier element on the content tree - "simple" in the sense that it has no children.

    Descendants of this class need only define a draw method for their framed content.

    Initialize a SimpleElement instance with

    :param size: the anticipated size of the rendering frame on the page.

    The SimpleElement assumes that the requested size and the final layout size are the same.
    This is not usually true - which could lead to unpleasant surprises:

    .. caution::
       The default measure and layout methods are very simple stubs.
       There is a strong chance that they will not do exactly what you want out-of-the-box.

    The default implementations of the RenderingFrame methods, however, effectively manage
    internal state variables for RenderingFrame so they should be called by any derivative
    implementations of this class.

    The class relationships for a SimpleElement instance are as follows:
