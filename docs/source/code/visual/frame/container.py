"""
Model a container frame that holds other content frames.

    - The container uses a LayoutStrategy instance to position reserved space for its children.
    - The children then do their own layout within the reserved extent.
    - At draw time, we get a region which fixes the containers coordinate system in absolute space.

class Container(RenderingFrame):
    """
    Model an interior element on the content tree - a "container" in the sense that owns child content.

    Containers aggregate child results upward.
    For example, a container's state is result of applying an aggregation algorithm to the states of child frames.

    A container uses a passed layout strategy instance to automatically handle block layouts.

    Initialize a container with the following.

    :param element_name: a unique name for the container for the logging stream
    :param requested_size: an estimated amount of space for the container
    :param child_elements: content frames to be laid out and drawn in this container
    :param layout_strategy: aggregated helper to lay out children in an extent

    Issues
    ------

        - can a rendering frame exist in multiple containers?  Well, no, because of its hardcoded state.
        - can I make a rendering frame stateless? or at least externalize the state into a context?
        - does this issue even matter?


    High level class relationships are as follows.

            This is under review as an experimental add for the ReportController abstraction.
            I'm not certain that I like this approach yet; it has all my design spidey-senses tingling.

            - Pass a value of 'None' on a key to remove that named frame from the container.
            - Pass a fresh instance of a frame on a key to replace that named frame
            - Pass a new key to add new frame content

        .. warning::
            This method mutates the internal frame map. Use cautiously.
            It assumes that any changed key has already had its `begin_page()` called.
            Ideally, I'd like to force the container's state into "needs_layout" if `update()` does anything to self.layout().
            Even better: forbid `update` entirely if we're not waiting to layout or finished with a page -
            i.e. the container is in an "intermission" state.
