"""
Model a single page in a report.

The Page class is the heart of the pagination algorithm for reports.

The pagination model works with three assumptions

1) Every ContentFrame instance manages its own content data

    - The ContentFrame can stream data through itself across multiple page or render the same data on every page
    - The draw() method of the interface updates the frame's state to indicate if

        - there's more unrendered data,
        - there's no more unrendered data but the frame can be reused to render the same data again, or
        - there's no more unrendered data and all the frame's data has been consumed.

2) Every ContentFrame has a begin_page() method

    - BeginPage signals the frame to refresh its buffers if necessary for new rendering data
    - The frame can indicate that it has nothing to do by returning False from being_page()

3) The Page itself is a ContentFrame/Container instance.

    - A report is typically managed by a controller
    - The controller implements a top-level version of begin_page() to create page layouts and populate page containers with ContentFrame
      instances as necessary.
    - For simple reports, usually only the report controller needs to implement begin_page(), but this breaks down as individual frames need
      to buffer data from some source.

- We manage physical page characteristics though a mutable global SETTINGS object that is an instance of PageSettings.
- These settings are frozen and then bound to a Page factory when we start a report - thus every new Page instance has the same physical
  properties unless the controller overrides these in the initializer call.
- The report controller typically derives from SimpleElement and implements the BeginPage method to create page layouts as needed
  from the page factory.
- Once the controller has a Page in hand, it populates it with ContentFrames and a layout strategy

.. note:: For a fixed layout, the controller only needs to create and populate one Page instance at the start of the job that it uses for
   every page.

- Because ContentFrame instances are sized dynamically to fit their content, the Page container governing the current output page must be
  measured and laid out before it is drawn.

The key feature to this model is that a report controller can make as many or as few general Page containers as it needs, varying physical
properties to fit its context.  For example,

    - the report control could have different Page layout schemes for even/odd pages for a bound book and a third layout for the first page
      of a chapter, or,
    - the first page of the report could be a content summary in portrait orientation followed by columnar output pages in landscape
      orientation of the results of an SQL query.

    There are two key roles that Page fulfils:

    Like any other RenderingFrame instance, a Page must be measured and laid out before it can be drawn.
    However, Page delegates upwards to its parent Container to execute these tasks.
