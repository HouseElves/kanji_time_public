==================================
Visual Separators: PageRule Frames
==================================

Python code file: visual/frame/page_rule.py

A `PageRule` frame draws a thin horizontal line, commonly used to separate content blocks.

This implementation is specialized as a `HorizontalRule`, but the design allows for vertical rules or fancier line-based separators in the future.

Key properties:

- Fully reusable
- Anchored by layout context
- Treated as content, not decoration
