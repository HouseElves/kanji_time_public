====================================
Render Vector Graphics: DrawingFrame
====================================

Python code file: visual/frame/drawing.py

The `ReportLabDrawing` frame renders vector graphics inside a layout frame, supporting scalable visual content aligned by anchor point.

This class wraps a ReportLab drawing object and integrates it into the layout and pagination engine.

While currently bound to ReportLab, it is designed to support future adapter-based backends (e.g., for SVG).
