===========================

Kanji Time relies on trusted open-source datasets to provide accurate character definitions, readings, stroke counts, radicals, and metadata for Japanese kanji and kana.

Currently integrated sources include:

    `KANJIDIC2 (kanji_dic2.xml) <https://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/KANJIDIC_Project>`_
        A comprehensive database of kanji readings, meanings, frequencies, radicals, and metadata.

    `KANJIDICT (kanjidict.xml) <https://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/KANJIDIC_Project>`_
         A companion dataset to KANJIDIC2 used primarily for additional glosses and semantic information.

    `KanjiSVG <https://kanjivg.tagaini.net/>`_
        A database of scalable vector graphics for (among other things) drawing kanji glyphs and illustrating kanji stroke order.

    `Unicode Radical Definitions <https://www.unicode.org/Public/15.1.0/ucd/CJKRadicals.txt>`_
        An extract from the Unicode database used to annotate traditional kanji radicals with Unicode-standard naming and references.
