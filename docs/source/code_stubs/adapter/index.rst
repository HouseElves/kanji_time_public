Adapter Package
===============

The :mod:`adapter` package contains shoehorning code to make ReportLab and generic Scalable Vector Graphics XMLs play nicely together.

The adapter library will continue to grow as new technologies are integrated into Kanji Time.

.. seealso:: See :ref:`rendering technology <rendering_technology>` for planned development of a formal separation of reports and their supporting rendering platform.
