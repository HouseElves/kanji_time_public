## Teaching Session Plans

### Session 1: Protocol-Based Architecture (90 min)

**Learning Goals:**
- Understand PEP 544 runtime-checkable protocols
- See how protocols enable plugin systems
- Learn separation of interface from implementation

**Code to Review:**
1. `visual/protocol/content.py` - The `RenderingFrame` protocol
2. `kanji_time_cli.py:155-282` - How CLI uses protocols
3. `reports/practice_sheet/report.py` - Plugin implementation

**Activities:**
1. Trace the execution flow from CLI through protocol
2. Design a new report plugin (on paper)
3. Discuss: "Why protocols instead of abstract base classes?"

**Homework:**
Implement a simple "Kanji Flashcard" report plugin

---

### Session 2: Immutable Value Types (90 min)

**Learning Goals:**
- Understand immutability benefits
- Learn namedtuple extension pattern
- Explore operator overloading

**Code to Review:**
1. `visual/layout/distance.py:112-470` - The Distance class
2. `visual/layout/region.py` - Extent, Pos, Region types
3. Test file: `visual/layout/test/test_distance.py`

**Activities:**
1. Create simple value type (Temperature with Celsius/Fahrenheit)
2. Add operator overloading (+, -, *, /)
3. Discuss: "Why immutability? What are the tradeoffs?"

**Demonstration:**
Show bug that immutability prevents:
```python
# Mutable - accidental modification
point = [0, 0]
def move(p): p[0] += 10  # Oops, modified shared state!

# Immutable - safe
Point = namedtuple('Point', 'x y')
point = Point(0, 0)
def move(p): return Point(p.x + 10, p.y)  # Returns new instance
```

---

### Session 3: Design Patterns in the Wild (90 min)

**Learning Goals:**
- Identify Gang of Four patterns in real code
- Understand when to use each pattern
- Learn pattern trade-offs

**Patterns Found in Kanji Time:**

| Pattern | Location | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Template Method** | `kanji_time_cli.py:155-282` | Define algorithm skeleton |
| **Strategy** | `visual/layout/stack_layout.py` | Layout algorithms |
| **Singleton** | `utilities/singleton.py` | One instance only |
| **Adapter** | `adapter/svg.py` | Convert between interfaces |
| **Factory** | `external_data/kanji_svg.py:61-72` | Create objects |

**Activities:**
1. Draw sequence diagrams for Template Method
2. Identify where Strategy could replace if/elif chains
3. Discuss: "Are patterns being used correctly here?"

---

### Session 4: Technical Debt - What & Why (90 min)

**Learning Goals:**
- Recognize different types of technical debt
- Understand intentional vs accidental debt
- Learn when to pay down debt

**Code to Review:**
1. `external_data/kanji_svg.py` - The "dirty" file
2. `utilities/general.py` - The dumping ground
3. `kanji_time_cli.py` - Magic numbers

**Activities:**
1. Categorize debt: "Ship it", "Fix soon", "Fix now", "Never ship"
2. Refactoring exercise: Split kanji_svg.py
3. Estimate: How long to pay down each debt item?

**Discussion Questions:**
- "Why did the developer ship code with 'deleted by GPT' markers?"
- "When is 'good enough' actually good enough?"
- "How do you decide what debt to tackle first?"

---

### Session 5: Testing Real Code (90 min)

**Learning Goals:**
- Read real test suites
- Identify coverage gaps
- Write tests for complex code

**Code to Review:**
1. `visual/layout/test/test_distance.py` - Well-written tests
2. `external_data/kanji_svg.py` - NO TESTS (why?)
3. Test structure and organization

**Activities:**
1. Run pytest and examine output
2. Identify: "What's not tested in kanji_svg.py?"
3. Write tests for one function in kanji_svg.py

**Coverage Exercise:**
```bash
pytest --cov=kanji_time --cov-report=html
# Open htmlcov/index.html
# Find the red (untested) lines
```

## Code Reading Checklist

When reviewing a new module, ask:

### Architecture
- [ ] What's this module's single responsibility?
- [ ] What are its dependencies? Are they appropriate?
- [ ] How does it fit in the overall system?
- [ ] What design patterns are used?

### Code Quality
- [ ] Are there type hints on public APIs?
- [ ] Is error handling consistent?
- [ ] Are variable names clear?
- [ ] Is there dead/commented code?
- [ ] Are there "TODO" or "FIXME" comments?

### Testing
- [ ] Is there a corresponding test file?
- [ ] What's tested? What's not?
- [ ] Are tests readable?
- [ ] Do tests have good names?

### Documentation
- [ ] Are docstrings present?
- [ ] Do docstrings explain *why*, not just *what*?
- [ ] Is there inline documentation for complex logic?
- [ ] Are there examples?

## Common Student Questions

### "Why use protocols instead of inheritance?"

**Short Answer:** Protocols allow structural typing (duck typing with type checking) without coupling.

**Example:**
```python
# Inheritance - tight coupling
class ReportBase(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def draw(self): ...

class MyReport(ReportBase):  # Must inherit
    def draw(self): ...

# Protocol - loose coupling
class RenderingFrame(Protocol):
    def draw(self): ...

class MyReport:  # No inheritance needed!
    def draw(self): ...  # Just implement the interface
```

**Benefits:**
- No inheritance hierarchy
- Can work with third-party classes
- Multiple protocols without multiple inheritance
- Runtime checking with `isinstance(obj, Protocol)`

---

### "Why is kanji_svg.py so complex?"

**Answer:** Evolution from Jupyter notebook to production code.

**Timeline:**
1. Started in Jupyter - quick prototype
2. Added features organically
3. Never refactored into clean modules
4. Ships working code but has technical debt

**Lessons:**
- Notebooks ‚Üí production requires refactoring
- "Working" ‚â† "well-designed"
- Refactoring is normal and necessary
- Complexity accumulates without discipline

---

### "Should I use match statements for type checking?"

**Short Answer:** No. Use match for *structural* patterns, not `isinstance()`.

**Bad (current code):**
```python
match stroke_range:
    case x if isinstance(x, int):  # This is just isinstance!
        ...
    case x if isinstance(x, list):
        ...
```

**Good - isinstance directly:**
```python
if isinstance(stroke_range, int):
    ...
elif isinstance(stroke_range, list):
    ...
```

**Good - structural match:**
```python
match point:
    case (0, 0):  # Origin
        ...
    case (x, 0):  # On x-axis
        ...
    case (0, y):  # On y-axis
        ...
```

---

### "When should I use a metaclass?"

**Short Answer:** Almost never. There's usually a simpler way.

**Use metaclasses for:**
- Enforcing subclass contracts (like Django models)
- Automatic registration of classes
- Modifying class creation behavior

**Don't use metaclasses for:**
- ‚ùå Caching (use `@lru_cache`)
- ‚ùå Singletons (use module-level instance)
- ‚ùå Validation (use `__init_subclass__`)

**Rule of thumb:** If you're not sure you need a metaclass, you don't.

---

### "How do I know when code is 'good enough' to ship?"

**Framework:**

**Must have:**
- ‚úÖ Solves the user's problem
- ‚úÖ No known security issues
- ‚úÖ No data-loss bugs
- ‚úÖ Core functionality tested

**Should have:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Good error messages
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Reasonable performance
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic documentation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some test coverage

**Nice to have:**
- üíö Beautiful code
- üíö 100% test coverage
- üíö Perfect documentation
- üíö Optimal performance

**Kanji Time shipped with:**
- All "must haves" ‚úÖ
- Most "should haves" ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Some "nice to haves" (good architecture, some beautiful code)

**The lesson:** Perfect is the enemy of shipped. Ship when "must haves" are done and document the debt.
