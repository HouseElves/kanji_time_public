Practice Sheet Report
=====================


.. admonition:: TODO

    - lazy(function_call()) that only executes the call if it absolutely has to.

        - lazy(iterable[function_call]) ?? or better:  call_on_demand() :-)


    - better nomenclature for DrawingForRL - build a useful adapter naming convention and adapter strategy!
    - style context manager push/pop
    - handle page settings overrides in the page factory-fetcher
    - a "replicate" container would be really useful:  ContentFrame + # times + a layout strategy
    - the page factory should deal with header/footer nonsense and keep track of page numbers
    - I need a database for kana - borrow heavily from Wiktionary -- see experiments.ipynb for REST queries
