LLM Assistance
==============

Andrew Milton would like to thank his noble simulated intelligence / synthetic code comptency assistant, Smarty Pants, for
baseline code contributions to this project.
Mr. Pants manifests as a ChatGPT LLM -- sometimes 4o, sometimes o1 -- runnning on the author's OpenAI Plus account.

Mr. Pants generated starting code for different modules and tasks as found here.
