Requirements Traceability Project
=================================

Overview
--------

This project introduces a lightweight, embedded system for associating explicit behavioral
requirements with their implementing classes and their corresponding test coverage. Each
requirement (``REQ``) is a single-sentence statement of intended behavior, written directly
into the source code or external requirement files.

This idea has been in consideration for decades, but has rarely been prioritized due to
organizational focus on short-term deliverables. However, it offers long-term benefits
for maintainability, regression safety, and architectural clarity—especially in DevOps and
automated validation contexts.

Current State
-------------

- REQs exist for core layout types (Distance, Extent, Pos, Region, etc.).
- REQ files are structured and extracted via a script (`get_reqs.sh`).
- Many unit tests verify specific REQs, although not yet explicitly linked.
- The REQ statements act as both documentation and a correctness specification.

Design Goals
------------

- Every core layout and rendering class should list its REQ coverage.
- Every REQ should be:
  - Easily findable in Sphinx docs.
  - Linked to the test or test class that verifies it.
- Diagrams should trace: ``Class ⇄ REQ ⇄ Test``.

Planned Enhancements
--------------------

1. **REQ ID Standardization**
   - Normalize to `REQ <Type>_<ID>` format.
   - Validate uniqueness during build/test.

2. **Test ↔ REQ Linking**
   - Add REQ markers to test functions (e.g., comments or decorators).
   - Enable test coverage auditing against REQs.

3. **Traceability Report**
   - Generate a machine-readable mapping:  `REQ_ID → Class → Test(s)`

4. **Visual Representation**
   - Produce Mermaid UML diagrams:

     - ``classDiagram`` or ``graph TD`` linking class, requirement, test.

5. **Sphinx Integration**
   - Render REQs and traceability as a browsable, searchable section of project documentation.

6. **CI/CD Hooks**

   - Add optional checks:

     - All REQs are tested.
     - All REQ IDs resolve.
     - No REQs are orphaned from implementation or test.

Long-Term Vision
----------------

This system provides clear answers to the most essential lifecycle questions:

- What is this component supposed to do?
- How do we know it does that?
- Where is the behavior defined and tested?

And perhaps most importantly:

- If we refactor this, what are we required to preserve?
